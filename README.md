## Projects
### Rice Classification - CNN , VGG16 (DL) :
[link](https://github.com/Divyapoojitha/RiceClassificationDL_CNN)

**Work done :** Classified a dataset of 75000 images of 5 rice varieties where 15000 images of
each variety are present . Developed two models CNN standard and a VGG16
model through transfer learning .

**Split percents :** 10 % of data used for testing and 90% for training.

**Libraries :** Pandas , Numpy , OpenCV , SciKit-learn , Tensorflow , keras

**Performance :** As the data was well processed and in correct proportions ,
achieved more than 95% accuracy in both models with some difference in no. of
epochs .


### Loan Prediction (EDA & ML) :

**Work done :** Directed a banking case study for credit risk prediction, utilizing diverse algorithms. Also Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis on customer features, offering actionable insights and recommendations to the bank using a credit risk scoring dataset and external resources .

**ML Algorithms utilized :** Logistic Regression , Random Forest , KNN , SVM ,Decision Treeâ€™s Randomized search CV

**Libraries for ML :** Pandas , Numpy , SciKit-learn 

**Libraries for EDA :** Matplotlib ,Seaborn , Pandas , Numpy

**Performance :** All models did perform well but decision tree's randomized search cv model is having higher performance with Test Score : 92% , Train Score : 93%
